<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I made this casserole recipe up and my kids love it! Chicken melds with lots of flavors like bacon, ranch, and Colby Jack to make a yummy feast for the whole family.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) package wide egg noodles</li>
    <li>1 pound bacon</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) container fat-free sour cream</li>
    <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix (such as Lipton® Recipe Secrets®)</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    <li>2 green onions, diced</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot skillet, sprinkle with lemon-pepper, and brown on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Combine 1/2 of the crumbled bacon, sour cream, soup, milk, and ranch dressing mix in a bowl and mix until blended. Pour over chicken, add drained egg noodles, and stir. Sprinkle remaining bacon on top, cover with Colby-Jack cheese, and top with green onions.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes.</li>
